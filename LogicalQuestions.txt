2. A wind is blowing from East to west you are living in a Island which is surrounded by ocean u dont have boat.
How will u survive?
Note - You cannot jump to ocean and swim if u jump u will die 

Ans - When the wind starts from East to west fire will also start from east to west
I will move towards west where there is no fire cut down a tree and travel from west to east by sitting on that wood
Once fire move from east to west there will be less / No fire in East so i will go there and survive 
Since everything on Island is burnt i will not have anything to east i will do fishing and survive
